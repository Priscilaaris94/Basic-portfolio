            <p class="font-family">I was born on November 2nd, 1994 in Mexico, City. My family moved to Atlanta GA in 1998 and it has become my home since then. When I was in high school, I decided to go to Mexico and learn more about my heritage and background. My senior year I moved to Mexico where I finished senior year with honors in a private school called Interntaional American School of Cancun. Soon after high school I decided to stay in Cancun and work in hospitality and tourism. My first job was at Ocean Coracl and Turquesa where I lived work and grew as a person. My job became my home where my team was my second family which made being away from my birth family less stressful. I let my job become my life because I loved every part of it.  </p>
            <p class="font-family">I had a career in hospitality and public relation for three years. After a while of living in Cancun; I moved back to Atlanta where I continued my studies in administrative business. I currently work in Goldstein Dental Center as a treatment coordinator and book keeper. My work there is amazing and I have learned a lot in the past year however, I am continuing my eduaction in web development because I love to challange myself.
