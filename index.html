            <p class="font-family">I was born on November 2nd 1994 in Mexico, City. My family moved to Atlanta GA in the year 1998 and it has become my home since then. When I was in high school I decied I wanted to go to Mexico and learn more about my haritage and backgroud, so on my senior year I moved to Mexico where I finish high school with honors in a private school called Interntaional American School of Cancun. Soon after, high school I decied to stay in Cancun and work in hospitality and tourism. My first job was in Ocean Coracl and Turquesa where I lived work and grew as a person. My job became my home where my team was my second family which made being away from my birth family less stressful. I let my job become my life because I loved every part of it.  </p>
